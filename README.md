## Usage

The easiest way to make a new R Markdown document is from within RStudio. Go to _File > New File > R Markdown_. From the new file wizard, you may:

+ Provide a document title (_optional but recommended_),
+ Provide an author name (_optional but recommended_),
+ Select a default output format- HTML is the recommended format for authoring, and you can switch the output format anytime (_required_), 
+ Click **OK** (_required_).

Once inside your new `.Rmd` file, you should see some boilerplate text that includes code chunks. Use the "Knit" button in the RStudio IDE to render the file and preview the output with a single click or use the keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K.
